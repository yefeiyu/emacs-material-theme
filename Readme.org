** EXPLAINED by Forker Yefeiyu
I modified the background color from *#263238* to *#061218*.

The origin yellow color is *#fff590d*, which was modified to *#ffff33*. 
Therefore, the difference between it and white is more significant.

The _EIN_ background color from _#1e2930_ to _0e1920_.

All of this is only an adjustment in depth and light, and overall does not affect the beauty of the original theme.
